üß† How It Works

NLP Analysis

The system analyzes user input using:

Sentiment Analysis: Detects emotional tone
Entity Recognition: Identifies people, organizations, locations
Question Detection: Recognizes interrogative patterns
Threat Assessment: Evaluates potential dangers
Paranoia Modeling

Parry's paranoia level (0.0-1.0) increases based on:

Negative sentiment in user messages
Mentions of authority figures
Questions (interpreted as interrogation)
Threat-related vocabulary
Medical or psychological terms
State Transitions

States change based on:

Trigger Words: Specific terms that immediately change state
Paranoia Level: Gradual progression through states
Conversation Context: Memory of previous interactions
Random Recovery: Occasional return to neutral state
Delusional Responses

When paranoia is high (>0.7), Parry generates responses based on:

Surveillance Delusions: "They're watching me"
Mind Control Delusions: "They're controlling my thoughts"
Persecution Delusions: "Everyone is plotting against me"
Grandeur Delusions: "I have special powers"
üéÆ Usage Tips

Triggering Different States

Suspicious: Ask questions ("Why?", "How?", "What?")
Angry: Use psychological terms ("crazy", "insane", "mental")
Fearful: Mention authority ("police", "government", "FBI")
Defensive: Discuss treatment ("medication", "therapy", "hospital")
Paranoid: Talk about surveillance ("cameras", "watching", "spying")
Delusional: Mention conspiracy or control ("conspiracy", "mind control")
Interface Controls

Sound Toggle: Enable/disable sound effects
Background Toggle: Enable/disable ambient music
Paranoia Meter: Real-time visualization of mental state
State Indicators: Shows current emotional state

üé≠ Historical Context

This advanced version builds upon the original Parry (1972) by Kenneth Colby, incorporating:

Modern NLP techniques
Psychological research on paranoid schizophrenia
Contemporary web technologies
Immersive user experience design
The original Parry was groundbreaking for demonstrating that computers could simulate human psychological states. This version extends that concept with sophisticated language understanding and realistic paranoia modeling.
